#Sort Manager - David Trieu
This project is a program which allows a user to select one of various sorting algorithms presented to them to sort a randomly generated array of integers.

The user is presented with a menu of options to select from. The user can then enter a number corresponding to the option they desire.

If the user selects a sorting algorithm, the user is then able to specify the number of integers the array should contain. All integers generated will be within the range 0 - 1000.

The program will generate a random array of integers and perform the specified sorting algorithm on it.

The program displays the name of the sorting algorithm selected, the unsorted randomly generated array, the sorted array after the algorithm is performed, and the time taken to perform it.

Afterwards, the user is brought back to the menu and is given an extra option to randomly generate a new array, as well as the same options from the start.

If the user selects a sorting algorithm again, it is performed on the existing generated array.

However if the user selects the generate new array option, a new array is generated and the user is brought back to the menu to select a sorting algorithm as normal.

The user is given the option to list all speeds of any algorithms performed on the existing generated array in any menu instance. This displays the time taken to perform each sorting algorithm the user has selected for the current randomly generated array.
